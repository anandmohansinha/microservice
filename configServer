I do not want any local conmfiguration of any project.All projects configuration has to be there at
 centralize place.
 For that we have to use config server.

 step 1: configure your config server.


spring:
  profiles:
    active: native
native profile tells the Config Server to load configuration files from the local classpath:/config folder or any specified location.
This is particularly useful for local development or testing, where you don't want to rely on a remote Git repository.

  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        native:
          search-locations: classpath:/configurations

 create a folder under resources name configurations

 Step 2: Go to main app class and add annotation @EnableConfigServer

step3: copy one by one all application.yml and put it in configurations folder in config-server
         and new file name will be same as original location(school/application.properties) below properties
         spring:
           application:
             name: schools

step 4: remove below line of code from (school.yml) file
  config:
    import: optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888

    because all properties are already there in config server
step 5: remove everything from (school/application.yml) except below properties
        spring:
          application:
            name: schools
          config:
            import: optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
